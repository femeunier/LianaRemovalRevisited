# # I am working as postdoc at Ghent University under the supervision of Hans Verbeeck and Wannes Hubau.
# # I am currently running a meta-analysis on the impact of lianas on tree allometries and I am contacting you to request data listed in the ForestPlots database.
# # In particular, I am interested in the individual tree DBH, species, height and liana infestation (COI) of the following plots:

# # As a member of the PI team (i.e. you are either the Principal investigator, Grant holder or Field leader)
# # for these plots/censuses we would be very grateful if you will grant permission to use your plot data
# # for this purpose. I have also contacted the other members of the PI team associated with these plots/censuses,
# # if however you know of anyone else that we need to contact to request permission please let me know so that
# # I can also write to them. If you have any doubts regarding this data request please discuss this with the PI team.
# #
# # This collaboration will adhere to the Code of Conduct described on the ForestPlots.net website and we would of course offer you co-authorship on
# # any resulting paper, keep you involved with progress, and include all acknowledgements that are appropriate.
# # The data will only be used for the purposes of the research stipulated above and will not be shared with any third parties.
# #
# # It would be very useful if you could reply - even just a brief yes to let us know if you are happy for your data to be used for this project.
# # I would be also very happy to give more details/explanation on this study if you'd wish.
